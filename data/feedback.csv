vY1JF5yT,barchart,"I looked at the range of outcomes and tried to see what would give the best 30 year return on average, estimating based on the periods shown.  It's really hard to estimate so I did the best I could with the information available.  I tried to avoid negative returns since those can be hard to recover from (i.e. it takes a 200% gain to cancel out a 50% loss and so on).  I also looked at the best possible outcome on the right side of the graph, especially if all the outcomes were in positive territory.",I looked at the range of outcomes and tried to maximize returns over 30 years.  I tried to avoid significant negative returns when possible.  I looked at the right-most (best) outcome as well and took it into account.  Overall I tried to estimate the range of outcomes and make the best estimate possible with the limited information available.
QA7eaZ58,interval,I make decision based on higher returns value ,Use color visual property i choose high return
5LdZf9d2,density,I looked at both charts and looked at the chance that each chart would provide a negative return and compared that to the chance of a positive return.  I also looked at how big the possible returns were on each chart.  I noticed it was often the case that one chart would have a relatively low but safe return while the other chart would have higher returns but also a chance for negative return.  If the chance for a negative return was low then I would put most of my money in the one that had a chance at highest returns. ,I just compared the lines to see which fund had the higher chance to provide higher returns when compared to the chance that the fund would provide a negative return. 
bYY2jRXC,table,"The best result is obviously the return at the end of the lifetime. As the amount is compounded, it is important to get the returns based on the higher return rate. The later stages have a higher increase and I focused on those funds that have a higher growth at the end.",I estimated the amount of growth on average by comparing the values at a glance. I didn't do any math but made it more as a ball park.

NoAbJ9SC,density,I used the chart to calculate the average possible outcome of each plan. Each node of the graph gives an idea to predict the average outcome of each of the investment plan. The graph gives you an idea about how risky a plan is by Hovering through the nodes of the graph.,The Lines helped to calculate the average outcome in years. The Ups and downs of the line give an idea about the outcome of the plan.

When making your chart, think about the specific information that you want your data to support, or the outcome that you want to achieve"
YzzaZbQb,table,"The chart acted as a tool to provide or help us take the investment decision. The positive and negative rate of return both were taken into account and calculated. Based on the calculation, a hypothetical figures were ascertained and then the computation took place. Based on that computation, the percentage was determined.",The chart acted as a tool or medium to ascertain the percentage that needs to be computed. The initial negative return and then the positive return helped us determine which investment option is good and would be allocated with higher percentage.

Ke6AO54Z,table,"First, I visualized the plans with the highest risk of loss by looking at the negative part of the graph, and tried to avoid them as much as possible. Then I tried to identify the biggest bar to the positive area to decide the biggest profit opportunity. Then I tried to identify the frequency of occurrences. Then cross this information to try to find the best risk x profit. I also used a little of my personal preference in never putting all the money in just 1 investment, always trying to diversify.","The same strategy as the previous item, try to avoid plans with a greater possibility of loss, ie too much negative numbers. Tried to find a higher frequency or quantity of positive values. And look for the highest rate of return, ie the highest positive value. Cross this information and try to find the best risk x profit. Still tried to diversify de investments."
pfuRg4QJ,barchart,"I used the chats to see the expected returns for the funds, and also tried to more so allocate my money into the less risky fund.","I used the charts to gather info on their interest returned, also tried to sift through which of the funds had the highest average return for that period."
aR6ZAxSB,barchart,"I looked to see the % of gain versus % of loss, then decided how to split the money depending on those percentages.","I used them the same way as round 1. Decided which fund had better % overall, how many years, then split my % depending on those numbers."
FvkXyNfJ,point,"I noted the charts with losses, and evaluated the potential loss versus potential gains. I would also put a smaller percentage of the investment in the smaller gaining fund that would have no potential loss, or smaller potential losses. I looked at the time periods of the funds, as one year is not a good time frame to judge by. ","I looked at the potential gains and losses much like last time. I did note the average returns on these charts, and again, the period of time that they covered. "

o0vmJ33w,table,"I looked at the minimum and maximum and the likelihood of a negative return, which I tried to avoid as much as possible. Mostly just compared what the mean return of the 2 funds looked like.",bit tougher to visualize than the charts. Paid a bit more attention to each individual number though and tried to see which fund had the higher rate of return in most positions compared to the other fund.
dn0ceftL,interval,I used the charts to see which fund had the higher rate of return. I also saw which one had higher chances of loss.,I used them to see what the likely return would be to see where and how I should invest

jWrAFb7o,density,i tended to select the one with the highest return although i also slightly tried to diversify my investment,i observed which one had the highest value along the right section (higher return) but also diversified a little to reduce the risk
73pjFxSt,point,I looked at the returns and tried to figure out which gave the best returns.  Higher returns had higher bars and/or more positive bars.,I looked at the average return dot.  I put all money into the fund with the higher return.
nP3o6Xld,point,I looked to see which had the best return. I also looked at negative returns. I tended to stay with the option that had little or no negative returns.,I wanted to lessen the chance that I would lose money so I tried to put some into both the safe and riskier options. The biggest factor was how far the max and min went.
ulloPKoy,density,"I based it on risk. If a fund had a high likelihood of a negative return, I allocated less money to that fund. ","I used the same process as before. If there was a higher area under the line that would produce a negative return, I allocated less money to that fund."

I then compared these to the length of time I was investing to determine how long I had to weather potential downturns to make up my investment.",I used the charts to determine where I would expect to be on average and what my potential downsides/upsides were.  I then used these representations to determine whether it made sense to be more risky depending on the length of time for my investments to grow.
Ckqp0S6g,point,I choose the average results of the chart values as my prediction higher value. That is my strategy.,I choose the average rate of return value and predict the between the last two best values. The chart gives me some best values to guess.
Y1nt7yaG,table,"One chart usually had lower lows and higher highs.  I tried to see where on that chart the values of gains started to approach the average and better-than-average gains on the other chart.  In other words, what percentage of the more volatile chart would do as well or better than the bulk of the less volatile chart?  If it seemed like a relatively safe bet that I'd get better returns from the more volatile chart, I went with that one, particularly if there weren't many real low bars (i.e. losses), and also if the time period was shorter.  I figured that being more aggressive over a longer time period made more sense, so I'd lean more heavily towards the higher-volatility chart for shorter time periods displayed by the chart.","I looked for what percentage of the more volatile chart was better than the less volatile chart.  usually there was quite a good chunk of the more volatile chart that was better than the vast majority of the less volatile chart.  That made it seem like it was a very good bet to go with the more volatile chart.  Yes, there was the possibility of poorer performance, but it was low.  And if the time period displayed was small, it was very likely that the higher volatility would work out over 30 years and so I should be even more aggressive and allocate more to the higher volatility set of data."
rk3wPfU9,hops,"I was looking for steady, slower growth over time for the longer-haul investments.

KJtTnWx0,dotplot,"I looked at the worst rates of return, especially if they were negative, to weight how much/how little I wanted to allocate to each fund. However, I thought it was also important to look at the highest values and use those to make the decision as well.","Kind of the same as before. But also since this isn't real money I felt more comfortable taking risks with the funds that had more of a negative return. YOLO and all that. If there was a cluster of dots that were spread out over a big range, I felt that was more of a risk than one where all the dots were clustered together."
Fk9KAr2Z,hopsdist,I looked for which chart had the higher potential gains as well as the less risky lows (such as not having a negative rate of return at all or at least only a small chance at a small loss over the 30 year time period).,"I determined which charts had the most high potential returns combined with not too many low or even negative returns, while also trying to minimize risk a bit by investing in both funds and putting some in the safer return fund."
HMvodXiB,interval,"I compared both sides and based on the rate of growth, I invested in the fund which had a better return percentage.","Based on the rate of return and the comparison with the number of years, I chose the better option.

I used the visuals to guage how much more I would earn in one investment vs. the other.,I compared the amount of money I might potentially earn from each investment to each other and then decided how to allocate my funds. It was harder to look at the dots than it was to look at the bar graphs from earlier.
UjjJWjHQ,barchart,"I looked for the lowest and the highest rates of return for each graph. Some were worth putting 100% because the odds were very good that, at minimum, I wouldn't lose money. I also considered, somewhat, the consistency of the returns and took that into account. ",I first looked at the consistency and then the highest and lowest rates of return for each. I am open to some risk but not high risk so if there was high risk of loss then I would scale back on that fund a little more than low risk of loss or low risk of smaller loss. 
ERx33R94,point,I was looking for at least 50% of the returns to be higher in one where I gave it higher weighting. The higher returns were worth the extra risk in some cases. ,"I found these not as useful. I looked for ones that had the least spread into the negative regions. However, these plots do not tell you anything about the relative probability of falling within this range, unlike the first one. Thus, my aim here was to preserve the investment."
n2ToGPvU,dotplot,"I looked for the general trends of return rates across the 30-year period. Additionally, I looked at the range of values displayed as even if all rates across the 30 years produced positive returns, it may be at the expense of a small return rate.

M2wTjbSE,point,"I looked at the charts to see which funds had greater variances and greater chances to earn more over the long term.  Because I was investing for 30 years, I chose the more volatile options, since I assumed they would be able to have larger gains because of the long time period.","Using this visual, I was able to easily see which fund had a better average return over time, because it was illustrated nicely in this type of graph.  In this case, I always chose the fund with the higher average return."

I then looked at how drastic the change in the bars position was. If one bar was ahead of the other bar I would choose more of that investment. If they bounced around a lot I would try to average their positions.
g1VQzaaH,point,I used the charts to compare returns for each time frame for the funds. I looked at the midpoint to estimate what funds would have the highest compounding interest at that point.,I used the midpoint to see the average rate of return.
