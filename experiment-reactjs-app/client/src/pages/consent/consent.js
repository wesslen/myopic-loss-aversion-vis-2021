        You are invited to participate in a research study. Participation in
        this research study is voluntary. The information provided on this form
        is to help you decide whether or not to participate.
      </p>

      <h2>Important Information You Need to Know</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The goal of this study is to understand the effect of{" "}
          <b>different data visualizations </b>
          on <b>investment financial decisions for retirement</b>. You will view
          data visualizations of <b>investment rates of return</b>. In each of
          the 14 tasks, you will view data visualizations of the{" "}
          <b>rates of returns</b> for two funds. You will then decide how you
          would <b>allocate a hypothetical investment</b> for retirement between
          the two funds as a percentage (0% to 100%).
        </li>
        <li>
          We are asking individuals who are age 18 or older and fluent in
          English to participate. Participation will take approximately 15
          minutes in total.
        </li>
        <li>
          For completing the study, you will receive <b>$1.00</b>. You are
          eligible for <b>optional incentives of up to $3.50</b> depending on
          your decisions. For each task (i.e., allocation decision), a model
          will simulate hypothetical results. Your bonus will be dependent on
          your relative performance compared to all possible scenarios using
          historical data simulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please read this form in order to decide whether to participate in
          this research study.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why are we doing this study?</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this study is to understand how different data
        visualizations may affect financial retirement decisions. You will be
        provided different simulated investment returns of different investable
        funds. You will then be asked to determine how much of investment funds
        you would allocate between the two funds in order to achieve the highest
        expected return. Please note that not all the details of this study are
        shared with you before the study. After you complete the study, we will
        explain in more detail information about the study.
      </p>

      <h2>Why are you being asked to be in this research study?</h2>
      <p>
        You are being asked to be in this study because you are age 18 and older
        and are fluent in English.
      </p>

      <h2>What will happen if I take part in this study?</h2>
      <p>
        If you choose to participate in this study, you will complete a
        computer-based task in which you will make decisions about hypothetical
        financial investments for retirement. After completing the task, you
        will be asked some questions about your experience as well as basic
        demographic questions (age, level of education, self-identified gender).
        Your total time commitment if you choose to participate will be
        approximately 15 minutes.
      </p>

      <h2>What benefits might I experience?</h2>
      <p>
        You will not benefit directly from being in this study. The broader
        benefits of this research include improved scientific understanding of
        how to improve retirement investment decisions with interactive data
        visualizations.
      </p>

      <h2>What risks might I experience?</h2>
      <p>
        We will show you simulated investment returns based on popular asset
        prices. There is a small chance you may mistake these returns for true
        values and could incorrectly affect your own personal investment
        decisions. Please do not take the investment returns in this study as
        actual nor take any information from this study to affect your own
        personal financial decisions.
      </p>

      <h2>How will my information be protected?</h2>
      <p>
        Research data collected as part of this study will remain confidential
        to the fullest extent possible and will only be disclosed with your
        permission or as required by law. Identifiable information (Amazon
        Mechanical Turk IDs) will not be collected or stored during this study.
        Records of your responses during the task will be linked to a randomized
        token only for payment purposes; your information will be permanently
        deleted when your payment is processed. Any additional information from
        the study (decisions, survey responses, etc.) will be stored in
        protected databases accessible only to the researchers.
      </p>

      <h2>How will my information be used after the study is over?</h2>
      <p>
        After the study is complete, study data may be shared with other
        researchers for use in other studies or as may be needed for publishing
        our results. The data we share will NOT include information that could
        identify you.
      </p>

      <h2>Will I receive an incentive for taking part in this study?</h2>
      <p>
        You will receive a minimum payment of $1.00 through Amazon Mechanical
        Turk upon completion of the study. In addition, you are eligible for
        additional incentives up to $3.50. If you decide to withdraw from the
        study prior to completion you will not be eligible for payment.
      </p>

      <h2>What are my rights if I take part in this study?</h2>
      <p>
        It is up to you to decide to be in this research study. Participating in
        this study is voluntary. Even if you decide to be part of the study now,
        you may change your mind and stop at any time. You do not have to answer
        any questions you do not want to answer.
      </p>
